Solutions for  Advent of Code (http://adventofcode.com/) in Elixir (http://elixir-lang.org/)

I never used elixir before so pretty much learning both the syntax and functional programming as I go.

Afterword
----------
Finished all the problems, lots of brute force and not a lot of thinking/algos
but the point for me was to try elixir and get a bit into functional programming.

It's a nice set of problems and very well presented so I might try to solve them again in a different
language or maybe revisit the elixir solutions once I'm more familiar with it.
